description: "Three passionate Uptown, NYC friends who love and enjoy movies break down their favorite films from current releases to older classics. No film is off-limits, no matter how obscure. Every week we announce a new film and give you a week to watch it...then we talk about it. This is our contribution to film appreciation."
