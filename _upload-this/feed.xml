    <title>Your Screen Is Not Dead</title>
    <description>Three passionate Uptown, NYC friends who love and enjoy movies break down their favorite films from current releases to older classics. No film is off-limits, no matter how obscure. Every week we announce a new film and give you a week to watch it...then we talk about it. This is our contribution to film appreciation.</description>

        <title>003 Aces High</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In ‘Aces High’ we discuss a CLASSIC. Casino, released in 1995 and directed by Martin Scorsese, is a movie the whole team has had a love affair with since screened as teenagers. We discuss Ace’s relationship with Ginger, Goodfellas vs Casino, and a detail most of you probably overlooked; the lighting.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>002 Ava: The Next Session</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In our second episode we tackle a Sci-Fi movie that we think is an instant classic, and one of the best movies this year; Ex-Machina! We cover gender roles, why the design of Ava is so cool, and  what we think happens once she’s out in the world.&lt;/p&gt;
