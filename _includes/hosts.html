    <h2>Jeffrey Herrera</h2>
    <p class="host-description">
        Jeffrey Herrera is a graphic designer living in New York City with a passion for all things visual. A minimalist at heart, his opinons are informed by efficiency of message and form. Being an art history buff, he makes connections between moments in time to offer a more in-depth look at references. When he's not designing, making music or watching films, he can be found playing with cats, eating tacos or baking cookies.

    <h2>Carlos Renaso</h2>
    <p class="host-description">
      Carlos Renaso, also known as "Eddy B" by close friends, is a New York City filmmaker currently working on developing his feature film, Uptown Roamers.  A graduate of Hunter College's film program, you can check out his short film work on Vimeo and his blog on his website link below, where he posts daily write-ups on his favorite films.  When he's not thinking of ways to conquer the film industry, he's writing Seinfeld-esque jokes because he foolishly believes he's funny.
