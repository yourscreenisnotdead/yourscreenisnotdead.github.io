    <h2>Jeffrey Herrera</h2>
    <p class="host-description">
        Jeffrey Herrera is a graphic designer living in New York City with a passion for all things visual. A minimalist at heart, his opinons are informed by efficiency of message and form. Being an art history buff, he makes connections between moments in time to offer a more in-depth look at references. When he's not designing, making music or watching films, he can be found playing with cats, eating tacos or baking cookies.

      Carlos Renaso, also known as "Eddy B" by close friends, is a New York City filmmaker currently working on developing his feature film, Uptown Roamers.  A graduate of Hunter College's film program, you can check out his short film work on Vimeo and his blog on his website link below, where he posts daily write-ups on his favorite films.
