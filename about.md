<div class="about">
YourScreenIsNotDead was formed by Jeffrey Herrera, Carlos Renaso, and Carlos Salcedo to be a weekly podcast where they could do what they normally do in their daily social gatherings; express their passionate opinions on films.  At every meetup, their conversations would always turn to movies and remain there for an extended period of time.  Thus, the idea was born to share their film enthusiasm with fellow movie-lovers online.  
<br><br>
For each episode, they will analyze and break a film down to its basic essentials, while discussing their favorite scenes, particular meanings, and themes.  They will cover a wide and rich range of films; everything from the martial arts film Five Deadly Venoms to the classic American comedy Annie Hall is up for discussion.  What sets them apart from other film podcasts, besides hailing from Uptown, New York City, is their ability to engage each other in a thought-provoking way enhancing each other's film viewing experience. This is their way of reaching their peers in the same way.  
<br><br>
In addition, this is their attempt to embrace the consumption of films through all formats of screening, whether theatrical or VOD.  Your Screen Is Not Dead brings together their love for films and an open-mindedness to broadcast it online while catering to all movie-lovers and consumers of media.
