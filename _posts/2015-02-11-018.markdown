subtitle: This week we watched Brian De Palma's <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0082085/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1" target="_blank">Blow Out</a>! The generally slept on stylistic and suspenseful Travolta film. We talk life vs media, the portrayal of 'Merica, Jack Terry's motivation, whether De Palma is a misogynist, and we black out in introspection a couple of times. Don't feed Carlos after midnight. <a href="/audible" target="_blank">Click here</a> to get a free audiobook and support the show!
